Conversations with our past selves.

One half: A record that we might look at now and again to comment on the
stuff that we've made.
The other half: quick and easy process to add commentary, low-burden,
content full of our respective personalities.

- dates
- reviews
- annotations

- thoughts from both of us
- dates, and counts
- commentary on the results and the process
- like a changelog (one time to another)
- optional additional comments every time
